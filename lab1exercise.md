# What I hope to learn in INFO 201

## Weiye Yu (BG)

I hope to **learn** how to *analyze data* and *visualize that data*. 

I think the skills that are going to be taught in this class are valuable in that:
- they're very applicable to my other field of interest
- they're applicable to many other fields of work
- they're interesting to learn
